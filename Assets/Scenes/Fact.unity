  facts:
  - title: "Rule 95 \u2013 Drink Driving"
    fact: ' Do not drink and drive as it will seriously affect your judgement and
      abilities.<br> In England and Wales you MUST NOT drive with a breath alcohol
      level higher than 35 microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol
      level of more than 80 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood.<br> In Scotland
      the legal limits are lower. You MUST NOT drive with a breath alcohol level higher
      than 22 microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol level of more
      than 50 milligrammes/100 '
  - title: "Rule 99 \u2013 Seat Belts"
    fact: You MUST wear a seat belt in cars, vans and other goods vehicles if one
      is fitted. Adults, and children aged 14 years and over, MUST use a seat belt
      or child restraint, where fitted, when seated in minibuses, buses and coaches.
      Exemptions are allowed for the holders of medical exemption certificates and
      those making deliveries or collections in goods vehicles when travelling less
      than 50 metres (approx 162 feet).
  - title: "Rule 101 \u2013 Baby Seats"
    fact: A rear-facing baby seat MUST NOT be fitted into a seat protected by an active
      frontal airbag, as in a crash it can cause serious injury or death to the child.
  - title: "Rule 103 \u2013 Signalling"
    fact: 'Signals warn and inform other road users, including pedestrians of your
      intended actions. You should always: <br>Give clear signals in plenty of time,
      having checked it is not misleading to signal at that time.<br>Use them to advise
      other road users before changing course or direction, stopping or moving off.<br>Cancel
      them after use.<br>make sure your signals will not confuse others. If, for instance,
      you want to stop after a side road, do not signal until you are passing the
      road. If you signal earlier it may give the impression that you intend to turn
      into the road. Your brake lights will warn traffic behind you that you are slowing
      down<br>use an arm signal to emphasise or reinforce your signal if necessary.
      Remember that signalling does not give you priority.'
  - title: "Rule 105 & 106 \u2013 Authority"
    fact: You MUST obey signals given by police officers, traffic officers, traffic
      wardens and signs used by school crossing patrols.<br><br>If the police want
      to stop your vehicle they will, where possible, attract your attention by flashing
      blue lights, headlights or sounding their siren or horn, usually from behind,
      or directing you to pull over to the side by pointing and/or using the left
      indicator. You MUST then pull over and stop as soon as it is safe to do so.
      Then switch off your engine.
  - title: "Rule 107 \u2013 Vehicle Standards Agency "
    fact: Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency officers have the power to stop vehicles
      on all roads, including motorways and trunk roads. They will attract your attention
      by flashing amber lights either from the front requesting you to follow them
      to a safe place to stop or from behind directing you to pull over to the side
      by pointing and/or using the left indicator.<br>It is an offence not to comply
      with their directions. You MUST obey any signals given.
  - title: "Rule 110 & 111 \u2013 Flashing Headlights"
    fact: Only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there.
      Do not flash your headlights to convey any other message or intimidate other
      road users.<br>Never assume that flashing headlights is a signal inviting you
      to proceed. Use your own judgement and proceed carefully.
  - title: "Rule 112 \u2013 The Horn"
    fact: The horn. Use only while your vehicle is moving and you need to warn other
      road users of your presence. Never sound your horn aggressively. You MUST NOT
      use your horn while stationary on the road or when driving in a built-up area
      between the hours of 11.30 pm and 7.00 am EXCEPT when another road user poses
      a danger.
  - title: "Rule 113 \u2013 Lighting"
    fact: You MUST ensure all sidelights and rear registration plate lights are lit
      between sunset and sunrise.<br>Use headlights at night, except on a road which
      has lit street lighting. These roads are generally restricted to a speed limit
      of 30 mph (48 km/h) unless otherwise specified.<br>Use headlights when visibility
      is seriously reduced.<br> Night (the hours of darkness) is defined as the period
      between half an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise.
  - title: "Rule 114 \u2013 Lighting #2"
    fact: "You MUST NOT:<br><br> \u2022\tUse any lights in a way which would dazzle
      or cause discomfort to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and
      horse riders.<br> \u2022\tUse front or rear fog lights unless visibility is
      seriously reduced. <br> In stationary queues of traffic, drivers should apply
      the parking brake and, once the following traffic has stopped, take their foot
      off the footbrake to deactivate the vehicle brake lights. This will minimise
      glare to road users behind until the traffic moves again."
  - title: "Rule 115 \u2013 Lighting #3"
    fact: "You should: <br><br> \u2022\tUse dipped headlights, or dim-dip if fitted,
      at night in built-up areas and in dull daytime weather, to ensure that you can
      be seen.<br> \u2022\tKeep your headlights dipped when overtaking until you are
      level with the other vehicle and then change to main beam if necessary, unless
      this would dazzle oncoming road users<br> \u2022\tSlow down, and if necessary
      stop, if you are dazzled by oncoming headlights."
  - title: "Rule 116 \u2013 Hazard warning Lights"
    fact: Hazard warning lights. These may be used when your vehicle is stationary,
      to warn that it is temporarily obstructing traffic. Never use them as an excuse
      for dangerous or illegal parking. You MUST NOT use hazard warning lights while
      driving or being towed unless you are on a motorway or unrestricted dual carriageway
      and you need to warn drivers behind you of a hazard or obstruction ahead. Only
      use them for long enough to ensure that your warning has been observed.
  - title: "Rule 117 \u2013 Braking in normal circumstances"
    fact: The safest way to brake is to do so early and lightly. Brake more firmly
      as you begin to stop. Ease the pressure off just before the vehicle comes to
      rest to avoid a jerky stop.
  - title: Rule 118 - Braking in an emergency
    fact: Brake immediately. Try to avoid braking so harshly that you lock your wheels.
      Locked wheels can lead to loss of control.
  - title: "Rule 119 \u2013 Skids"
    fact: Skidding is usually caused by the driver braking, accelerating or steering
      too harshly or driving too fast for the road conditions. If skidding occurs,
      remove the cause by releasing the brake pedal fully or easing off the accelerator.
      Turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid. For example, if the rear
      of the vehicle skids to the right, steer immediately to the right to recover.
  - title: "Rule 120 \u2013 ABS"
    fact: If your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock brakes, you should follow the advice
      given in the vehicle handbook. However, in the case of an emergency, apply the
      footbrake firmly; do not release the pressure until the vehicle has slowed to
      the desired speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained,
      but do not assume that a vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter distance.
  - title: "Rule 221 \u2013 Brakes affected by water"
    fact: If you have driven through deep water your brakes may be less effective.
      Test them at the first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal
      to make sure that they work. If they are not fully effective, gently apply light
      pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them out.
  - title: "Rule 122 \u2013 Coasting"
    fact: "This term describes a vehicle travelling in neutral or with the clutch
      pressed down. It can reduce driver control because<br> \u2022\tengine braking
      is eliminated<br> \u2022\tvehicle speed downhill will increase quickly<br> \u2022\tincreased
      use of the footbrake can reduce its effectiveness<br> \u2022\tsteering response
      will be affected, particularly on bends and corners<br> \u2022\tit may be more
      difficult to select the appropriate gear when needed. "
  - title: "Rule 123 \u2013 The Driver and the Environment."
    fact: You MUST NOT leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or
      leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary
      on a public road. Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain
      so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and
      switch off the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is
      permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary in traffic
      or for diagnosing faults.
  - title: "Rule 124 \u2013 Speed limits"
    fact: You MUST NOT exceed the maximum speed limits for the road and for your vehicle.
      The presence of street lights generally means that there is a 30 mph (48 km/h)
      speed limit unless otherwise specified.
  - title: "Rule 124 \u2013 Speed limits for Cars and motorcycles"
    fact: "Speed limits vary depending on the type of vehicle and what road the vehicle
      is travelling on.<br><br> For cars and motorcycles:<br> \u2022\tBuilt up areas
      = 30 mph (48 km/h)<br> \u2022\tSingle carriageways = 60 mph (96 km/h) <br> \u2022\tDual
      carriageways = 70 mph (112 km/h) <br> \u2022\tMotorways = 70 mph (112 km/h)"
  - title: "Rule 124 \u2013 Speed limits for Cars towing caravans or trailers"
    fact: "Speed limits vary depending on the type of vehicle and what road the vehicle
      is travelling on.<br><br>  For cars towing caravans or trailers:<br> \u2022\tBuilt
      up areas = 30 mph (48 km/h) <br> \u2022\tSingle carriageways = 50 mph (80 km/h)

      mph (96 km/h)"
  - title: "Rule 124 \u2013 Speed limits for Buses, coaches and minibuses  "
    fact: "Speed limits vary depending on the type of vehicle and what road the vehicle
      is travelling on.<br><br>  For buses, coaches and minibuses:<br> \u2022\tBuilt
      up areas = 30 mph (48 km/h) <br> \u2022\tSingle carriageways = 50 mph (80 km/h)

      mph (112 km/h) "
  - title: "Rule 124 \u2013 Speed limits for Goods vehicles (not exceeding 7.5 tonnes
      maximum laden weight)"
    fact: "Speed limits vary depending on the type of vehicle and what road the vehicle
      is travelling on.<br><br>  For goods vehicles (UNDER 7.5 tonnes) :<br> \u2022\tBuilt
      up areas = 30 mph (48 km/h) <br> \u2022\tSingle carriageways = 50 mph (80 km/h)

      mph (112 km/h) "
  - title: "Rule 125 \u2013 Speed Limit"
    fact: "The speed limit is the absolute maximum and does not mean it is safe to
      drive at that speed irrespective of conditions. Driving at speeds too fast for
      the road and traffic conditions is dangerous. You should always reduce your
      speed when<br><br> \u2022\tthe road layout or condition presents hazards, such
      as bends<br> \u2022\tsharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders,
      particularly children, and motorcyclists<br> \u2022\tweather conditions make
      it safer to do so<br> \u2022\tdriving at night as it is more difficult to see
      other road users."
  - title: "Rule 126 \u2013 Typical Stopping Distances"
    fact: "Drive at a speed that will allow you to stop well within the distance you
      can see to be clear. You should<br><br> \u2022\tleave enough space between you
      and the vehicle in front so that you can pull up safely if it suddenly slows
      down or stops. The safe rule is never to get closer than the overall stopping
      distance<br> \u2022\tallow at least a two-second gap between you and the vehicle
      in front on roads carrying faster-moving traffic and in tunnels where visibility
      is reduced. The gap should be at least doubled on wet roads and increased still
      further on icy roads<br> \u2022\tremember, large vehicles and motorcycles need
      a greater distance to stop. If driving a large vehicle in a tunnel, you should
      allow a four-second gap between you and the vehicle in front. <br> If you have
      to stop in a tunnel, leave at least a 5-metre gap between you and the vehicle
      in front."
  - title: "Rule 126 \u2013 Stopping Distances #2"
    fact: "Stopping distances vary, the distances shown are a general guide. The distance
      will depend on your attention, the road surface, the weather conditions and
      the condition of your vehicle at the time<br><br> \u2022\t20 mph (32 km/h) =
      12 metres (40 feet) or three car lengths.<br> \u2022\t30 mph (48 km/h) = 23
      metres (75 feet) or six car lengths. <br> \u2022\t40 mph (64 km/h) = 36 metres
      (118 feet) or nine car lengths. <br> \u2022\t50 mph (80 km/h) = 53 metres (175
      feet) or thirteen car lengths. <br> \u2022\t60 mph (96 km/h) = 73 metres (240
      feet) or eighteen car lengths. <br> \u2022\t70 mph (112 km/h) = 96 metres (315
      feet) or twenty-four car lengths."
  - title: "Rule 127 \u2013 Broken White Line"
    fact: A broken white line. This marks the centre of the road. When this line lengthens
      and the gaps shorten, it means that there is a hazard ahead. Do not cross it
      unless you can see the road is clear and wish to overtake or turn off.
  - title: Rule 128 - Double white lines where the line nearest to you is broken.
    fact: This means you may cross the lines to overtake if it is safe, provided you
      can complete the manoeuvre before reaching a solid white line on your side.
      White direction arrows on the road indicate that you need to get back onto your
      side of the road.
  - title: 'Rule 129 - Double white lines where the line nearest you is solid. '
    fact: Double white lines where the line nearest you is solid. This means you MUST
      NOT cross or straddle it unless it is safe and you need to enter adjoining premises
      or a side road. You may cross the line if necessary, provided the road is clear,
      to pass a stationary vehicle, or overtake a pedal cycle, horse or road maintenance
      vehicle, if they are travelling at 10 mph (16 km/h) or less.
  - title: "Rule 130 \u2013 Areas of white diagonal stripes"
    fact: "Areas of white diagonal stripes or chevrons painted on the road. These
      are to separate traffic lanes or to protect traffic turning right.<br><br> \u2022\tIf
      the area is bordered by a broken white line, you should not enter the area unless
      it is necessary and you can see that it is safe to do so.<br> \u2022\tIf the
      area is marked with chevrons and bordered by solid white lines you MUST NOT
      enter it except in an emergency. "
  - title: "Rule 131 \u2013 Lane Dividers"
    fact: Lane dividers. These are short, broken white lines which are used on wide
      carriageways to divide them into lanes. You should keep between them.
  - title: "Rule 132 \u2013 Reflective road studs"
    fact: "Reflective road studs may be used with white lines.<br><br> \u2022\tWhite
      studs mark the lanes or the middle of the road. <br> \u2022\tRed studs mark
      the left edge of the road. <br> \u2022\tAmber studs mark the central reservation
      of a dual carriageway or motorway. <br> \u2022\tGreen studs mark the edge of
      the main carriageway at lay-bys and slip roads. <br> \u2022\tGreen/yellow studs
      indicate temporary adjustments to lane layouts, e.g. where road works are taking
      place."
  - title: "Rule 133 \u2013 Changing lane"
    fact: If you need to change lane, first use your mirrors and if necessary take
      a quick sideways glance to make sure you will not force another road user to
      change course or speed. When it is safe to do so, signal to indicate your intentions
      to other road users and when clear, move over.
  - title: "Rule 134 \u2013 Lane Discipline"
    fact: You should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane as directed.
      In congested road conditions do not change lanes unnecessarily. Merging in turn
      is recommended but only if safe and appropriate when vehicles are travelling
      at a very low speed, e.g. when approaching road works or a road traffic incident.
      It is not recommended at high speed.
  - title: "Rule 135 & 136 \u2013 Single carriageway"
    fact: "Where a single carriageway has three lanes and the road markings or signs
      do not give priority to traffic in either direction<br><br> \u2022\tuse the
      middle lane only for overtaking or turning right. Remember, you have no more
      right to use the middle lane than a driver coming from the opposite direction<br>
      \u2022\tdo not use the right-hand lane.<br> Where a single carriageway has four
      or more lanes, use only the lanes that signs or markings indicate."
  - title: "Rule 137 & 138 \u2013 Dual carriageways"
    fact: A dual carriageway is a road which has a central reservation to separate
      the carriageways.<br> On a two-lane dual carriageway you should stay in the
      left-hand lane. Use the right-hand lane for overtaking or turning right. After
      overtaking, move back to the left-hand lane when it is safe to do so.<br> On
      a three-lane dual carriageway, you may use the middle lane or the right-hand
      lane to overtake but return to the middle and then the left-hand lane when it
      is safe.
  - title: "Rule 139 \u2013 Climbing and crawler lanes."
    fact: Climbing and crawler lanes. These are provided on some hills. Use this lane
      if you are driving a slow-moving vehicle or if there are vehicles behind you
      wishing to overtake. Be aware of the signs and road markings which indicate
      the lane is about to end.
  - title: "Rule 140 \u2013 Cycle lanes"
    fact: Cycle lanes. These are shown by road markings and signs. You MUST NOT drive
      or park in a cycle lane marked by a solid white line during its times of operation.
      Do not drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a broken white line unless it
      is unavoidable. You MUST NOT park in any cycle lane whilst waiting restrictions
      apply.
  - title: 'Rule 141 - Bus lanes. '
    fact: Bus lanes. These are shown by road markings and signs that indicate which

      You may enter a bus lane to stop, to load or unload where this is not prohibited.
  - title: "Rule 143 \u2013 One-Way streets"
    fact: "One-way streets. Traffic MUST travel in the direction indicated by signs.
      Buses and/or cycles may have a contraflow lane. Choose the correct lane for
      your exit as soon as you can. Do not change lanes suddenly. Unless road signs
      or markings indicate otherwise, you should use<br><br> \u2022\tthe left-hand
      lane when going left<br> \u2022\tthe right-hand lane when going right<br> \u2022\tthe
      most appropriate lane when going straight ahead. Remember \u2013 traffic could

    fact: "Adapt your driving to the appropriate type and condition of road you are
      on. In particular<br><br> \u2022\tdo not treat speed limits as a target. It
      is often not appropriate or safe to drive at the maximum speed limit<br> \u2022\ttake
      the road and traffic conditions into account. Be prepared for unexpected or
      difficult situations, for example, the road being blocked beyond a blind bend.
      Be prepared to adjust your speed as a precaution<br> \u2022\twhere there are
      junctions, be prepared for road users emerging<br> \u2022\tin side roads and
      country lanes look out for unmarked junctions where nobody has priority<br>

      18, including motor caravans. In Scotland it is an offence for anyone aged 18
      or over to smoke in a private motor vehicle (unless it is parked and being used
      as living accommodation) when there is someone under 18 in the vehicle and the
      vehicle is in a public place.
  - title: "Rule 149 \u2013 Mobile phones"
    fact: You MUST exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times. You MUST
      NOT use a hand-held mobile phone, or similar device, when driving or when supervising
      a learner driver, except to call 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency when it is
      unsafe or impractical to stop. Never use a hand-held microphone when driving.
      Using hands-free equipment is also likely to distract your attention from the
      road. It is far safer not to use any telephone while you are driving or riding
      - find a safe place to stop first or use the voicemail facility and listen to
      messages later.<br><br> You may park your vehicle using a hand-held remote control
      app or device. The app or device MUST be legal, and you should not put other
      people in danger when you use it.
  - title: "Rule 150 \u2013 Distractions"
    fact: There is a danger of driver distraction being caused by in-vehicle systems
      such as satellite navigation systems, congestion warning systems, PCs, multi-media,
      etc. You MUST exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times. Do not rely
      on driver assistance systems such as motorway assist, lane departure warnings,
      or remote control parking. They are available to assist but you should not reduce
      your concentration levels. Do not be distracted by maps or screen-based information
      (such as navigation or vehicle management systems) while driving or riding.
      If necessary find a safe place to stop.<br><br>As the driver, you are still
      responsible for the vehicle if you use a driver assistance system (like motorway
      assist). This is also the case if you use a hand-held remote control parking
      app or device. You MUST have full control over these systems at all times.
  - title: Rule 151 slow-moving traffic
    fact: "In slow-moving traffic. You should<br><br> \u2022\treduce the distance
      between you and the vehicle ahead to maintain traffic flow<br> \u2022\tnever
      get so close to the vehicle in front that you cannot stop safely<br> \u2022\tleave
      enough space to be able to manoeuvre if the vehicle in front breaks down or
      an emergency vehicle needs to get past<br> \u2022\tnot change lanes to the left
      to overtake<br> \u2022\tallow access into and from side roads, as blocking these
      will add to congestion<br> \u2022\tbe aware of cyclists and motorcyclists who
      may be passing on either side."
  - title: "Rule 152 \u2013 Residential streets"
    fact: "Residential streets. You should drive slowly and carefully on streets where
      there are likely to be pedestrians, cyclists and parked cars. In some areas
      a 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum speed limit may be in force. Look out for<br><br>
      \u2022\tvehicles emerging from junctions or driveways<br> \u2022\tvehicles moving
      off<br> \u2022\tcar doors opening<br> \u2022\tpedestrians<br> \u2022\tchildren
      running out from between parked cars<br> \u2022\tcyclists and motorcyclists."
  - title: "Rule 153 \u2013 Traffic-calming measures."
    fact: On some roads there are features such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings
      which are intended to slow you down. When you approach these features reduce
      your speed. Allow cyclists and motorcyclists room to pass through them. Maintain
      a reduced speed along the whole of the stretch of road within the calming measures.
      Give way to oncoming road users if directed to do so by signs. You should not
      overtake other moving road users while in these areas.
  - title: Rule 154 - Country roads
    fact: Take extra care on country roads and reduce your speed at approaches to
      bends, which can be sharper than they appear, and at junctions and turnings,
      which may be partially hidden. Be prepared for pedestrians, horse riders, cyclists,
      slow-moving farm vehicles or mud on the road surface. Make sure you can stop
      within the distance you can see to be clear. You should also reduce your speed
      where country roads enter villages.
  - title: "Rule 155 \u2013 Single track roads"
    fact: Single-track roads. These are only wide enough for one vehicle. They may
      have special passing places. If you see a vehicle coming towards you, or the
      driver behind wants to overtake, pull into a passing place on your left, or
      wait opposite a passing place on your right. Give way to road users coming uphill
      whenever you can. If necessary, reverse until you reach a passing place to let
      the other vehicle pass. Slow down when passing pedestrians, cyclists and horse
      riders.
